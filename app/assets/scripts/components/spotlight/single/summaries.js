        Chinese authorities suspended travel and closed businesses in late
        January 2020 in response to the novel coronavirus. Satellite
        observations since then have revealed changes in activity for Beijing’s
        21 million residents, including changes in fossil fuel emissions and
        other economic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lockdowns and social distancing measures implemented in response to the
        coronavirus pandemic led to significant but temporary reductions in
        nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil
        fuel combustion and other human activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using observations from the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2)
        and Japan’s Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), scientists
        were able to identify enhancements in ambient CO2 concentrations from
        things like fossil fuel emissions over cities, which are only detectable
        lower down in the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Beijing, while enhancements in CO2 concentrations vary substantially
        from month-to-month generally, the 2020 levels are much lower than in
        earlier years. While this behavior is consistent with reported
        coronavirus-related reductions in fossil fuel emissions, it is important
        to remember that these results include variations in CO2 concentrations
        not only from COVID-19 shutdowns, but also from other processes such as
        photosynthesis and respiration from plants and transport by passing
        weather systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, researchers are using night light observations to track
        variations in Beijing’s energy use and other economic indicators based
        on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which highways were
        shut down, and which cities stayed the same.

        Located on the North Sea on the coast of Belgium, the Port of Ghent is a
        highly trafficked seaport. By focusing on changes in this typically
        bustling area, researchers are able to compare changes in nightlights,
        an indicator of economic activity before and after novel coronavirus
        lockdowns began.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nightlight observations from space track variations in energy use,
        migration, and transportation. By comparing regions before and after
        guidelines to shelter-in-place began, researchers visualize the extent
        to which social distancing measures affected various economic activities
        based on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which highways
        were shut down, and which cities stayed the same.

        The Port of Dunkirk is the third-largest maritime port in northern
        France. Located on the busy North Sea, the port is well known for the
        comings and goings of heavy cargo barges. In early March, following
        French government guidance, the port began to limit activity in response
        to the novel coronavirus. Researchers are using night lights to track
        variations in energy use, migration, and transportation at the port in
        response to social distancing and lockdown measures. They are able to
        visualize the extent social distancing measures impacted various
        economic activities based on whether light pollution increased or
        decreased, which highways were shut down, and which cities stayed the
        same.

        California was the first state in the U.S. to set mandatory stay-at-home
        restrictions in an attempt to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
        These orders went into effect for the whole state on March 19, 2020,
        including for the city of Los Angeles and its approximately 4 million
        residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the lockdown, LA saw cleaner air and quieter streets:
        observations from NASA’s Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) detected a
        31% decrease in nitrogen dioxide, a common air pollutant, as car traffic
        and other activity came to a relative halt. Nightlights data also
        revealed darkened commercial zones where there was once bustling
        activity. The Port of Los Angeles, the busiest port in the U.S. and one
        of the busiest ports in the world, reported overall shipping cargo
        volumes were down 19% for the first five months of 2020, compared to
        2019.

        As COVID-19 cases soared in New York City, more than 8 million residents
        sheltered-in-place or fled the city. It remained in lockdown with strict
        social distancing measures in place for more than two months, from March
        through June 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        Satellite data reveal how changes in fossil fuel emissions and other
        economic activity during coronavirus-related lockdowns affected New York
        City’s air, land, and water. These data help visualize how
        neighborhoods, commercial centers, and more changed due to social
        distancing measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shelter-in-place orders have led to significant but temporary reductions
        in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil
        fuel combustion and other human activities, improving local air quality
        at least for a short time. Beginning in March, the Northeast U.S. saw
        reductions of 30% across most major metropolitan areas, including New
        York City. Observations and analysis of CO2 concentration enhancements
        (i.e., fossil fuel emissions from cities that contribute to higher
        levels of CO2 lower down in the atmosphere) in New York City found that
        CO2 values were higher than normal in January 2020, close to normal for
        February, and lower in March, as lockdowns were imposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note, however, that variations in CO2 concentrations
        are also affected by other processes such as photosynthesis and
        respiration by plants, and transport by passing weather systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Citywide restrictions are expected to dramatically alter the amount and
        location of nutrients flowing into New York’s Long Island Sound,
        possibly altering water quality. Data from NASA, the U.S. Geological
        Survey, and the European Commission’s Copernicus satellite missions show
        changes in both Long Island Sound and New York Harbor water quality in
        both chlorophyll-a concentrations (algae) and sediments (how murky the
        water is). However, both chlorophyll-a concentrations and sediment
        levels fluctuate naturally based on a variety of factors, including
        natural geography and the weather. More work is ongoing to assess the
        main factors driving these changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with other cities, researchers can compare the extent to which social
        distancing measures impacted various economic activities in New York
        City based on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which
        highways were shut down, and which areas stayed the same.

        California was one of the first states to implement COVID-19
        restrictions. A shelter-in-place mandate went into effect for six
        counties in the San Francisco metropolitan area on March 17, 2020. While
        the mandate was in effect, non-essential businesses were closed, and
        approximately 6.7 million residents in the area were asked to stay home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nighttime lights data show an abrupt decrease in night lights
        corresponding to the onset of the shelter-in-place order. The location
        of decreased lights – predominantly in the central business districts,
        market areas, and entertainment districts – can be identified in the
        “before” and “after” imagery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Satellite data reveal clearing of the air and improvements in water
        quality during the lockdown. According to observations from the Ozone
        Monitoring Instrument (OMI), San Francisco experienced an estimated 22%
        reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels after restrictions were
        implemented. Chlorophyll-a measurements (an indicator of water nutrient
        levels and algae growth) over south San Francisco Bay, along with
        on-the-ground reports, indicate improved water quality during the
        shelter-in-place order. However, such effects may be obscured by
        less-than-normal rainfall in the spring, coupled with high temperatures
        and cloudiness in the region, which naturally limit algae growth.

        Japan declared a state of emergency in its two largest cities, Tokyo and
        Osaka, and five of their surrounding prefectures in response to the
        coronavirus pandemic on April 7, 2020. While the declaration allowed
        these municipalities to request that residents remain at home, it was
        not mandatory.
      </p>

        In Tokyo and around the world, researchers are using satellite data to
        study how stay-at-home orders are affecting the environment around us.
        Nightlights data track variations in energy use, migration, and
        transportation, and nitrogen dioxide data track changes in
        transportation and energy use in response to social distancing and
        lockdown measures.{' '}

        Each spotlight city has a slider for turning night lights and nitrogen
        dioxide data layers on and off. By comparing regions before and after
        guidelines to shelter-in-place began, researchers are able to visualize
        the extent to which social distancing measures impacted various economic
        activities based on whether light pollution or NO2 levels increased or
        decreased.
