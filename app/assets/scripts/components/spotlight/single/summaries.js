      <p>
        MAAP User Working Group members have developed a biomass product using covariates from Landsat8, ICESat2 Canopy Heights and Copernicus DEM for the boreal region. This region is 50 degrees - 75 degrees N and encompasse all of Eurasia. The MAAP makes it possible for UWG members to collaborate virtually and scale their science using the MAAP Algorithm Development Environment (ADE) and Data Processing System (DPS).

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Inputs:</em> Pictured are the inputs to the final biomass product as well as the final product itself. Landsat8 Covariates are a UWG-generated product. ICESat-2 ATL08 is included as a dependent variable in the model and is shown here colored based on canopy height.
      </p>
      <p>The MAAP will enable international scientific collaboration on biomass mapping. Later on in this year, MAAP scientists will use the platform to share and request other groupsâ€™ biomass products to enable harmonization of those different products.
