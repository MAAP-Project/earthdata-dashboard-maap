        Chinese authorities suspended travel and closed businesses in late
        January 2020 in response to the novel coronavirus. Satellite
        observations since then have revealed changes in activity for Beijing’s
        21 million residents, including changes in fossil fuel emissions and
        other economic activity.

        Lockdowns and social distancing measures implemented in response to the
        coronavirus pandemic led to significant but temporary reductions in
        nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil
        fuel combustion and other human activities.

        Located on the North Sea on the coast of Belgium, the Port of Ghent is a
        highly trafficked seaport. By focusing on changes in this typically
        bustling area, researchers are able to compare changes in nightlights,
        an indicator of economic activity before and after novel coronavirus
        lockdowns began.

        The Port of Dunkirk is the third-largest maritime port in northern
        France. Located on the busy North Sea, the port is well known for the
        comings and goings of heavy cargo barges. In early March, following
        French government guidance, the port began to limit activity in response
        to the novel coronavirus.

        California was the first state in the U.S. to set mandatory stay-at-home
        restrictions in an attempt to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
        These orders went into effect for the whole state on March 19, 2020,
        including for the city of Los Angeles and its approximately 4 million
        residents. During the lockdown, LA saw cleaner air and quieter streets.

        As COVID-19 cases soared in New York City, more than 8 million residents
        sheltered-in-place or fled the city. It remained in lockdown with strict
        social distancing measures in place for more than two months, from March
        through June 2020.

        Satellite data reveal how changes in fossil fuel emissions and other
        economic activity during coronavirus-related lockdowns affected New York
        City’s air, land, and water. These data help visualize how
        neighborhoods, commercial centers, and more changed due to social
        distancing measures.

        California was one of the first states to implement COVID-19
        restrictions. A shelter-in-place mandate went into effect for six
        counties in the San Francisco metropolitan area on March 17, 2020. While
        the mandate was in effect, non-essential businesses were closed, and
        approximately 6.7 million residents in the area were asked to stay home.

        Japan declared a state of emergency in its two largest cities, Tokyo and
        Osaka, and five of their surrounding prefectures in response to the
        coronavirus pandemic on April 7, 2020. While the declaration allowed
        these municipalities to request that residents remain at home, it was
        not mandatory.

        In Tokyo and around the world, researchers are using satellite data to
        study how stay-at-home orders are affecting the environment around us.
        Nightlights data track variations in energy use, migration, and
        transportation, and nitrogen dioxide data track changes in
        transportation and energy use in response to social distancing and
        lockdown measures.{' '}
